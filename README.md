NBA Data Collection
===

This is a series of Python scripts I have put together to collect individual player data from the NBA. The scripts are set to collect and save the data to a series of `.csv` files.

These are a series of files I wrote before learning to use git and as such, they are iterations of each other. When I get some time, I'll go through and clean them up and keep the most useful ones while eliminating any redundancies.

Eventually, this will become a repository for a python package geared towards pull NBA statistics easily into python for more in-depth personal analysis.
